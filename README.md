## ArcGIS for Canadian Municipalities - Election Results 10.2

The Election Results application provides a map-based view of voting results tabulated on election night for each polling division. To display the results, the user can enter an address or polling division number in the search box or click on the map. The polling division will be highlighted and the voting results will be displayed in the tabs along the bottom of the map.

The application is highly configurable and works with the [Canadian Municipal Data Model](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0487111bd16a4c2ca757687d588aa783 "Download the Data Model").  It can be deployed and used on desktop, smartphones or tablet devices.
